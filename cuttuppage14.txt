Our Pledge

The Monsanto Pledge is our commitment  to how we do business. As "ufochick" writes at DavidIcke. It's all part of Azhorra-Tha's grand master plan.  This is why you don't put that stuff in the microwave.In the past, doctors used wire to repair the sternum, but this was problematic because bony fragments moved and did not remain aligned. We're not a cult, we're just a gathering of friends. Verdict: Gingrich is a reptilian.Above: Self-reported experiences of the Hum, recorded as part of The World Hum Map and Database by Glen MacPhearson, British Columbia.
