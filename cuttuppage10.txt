 This procedure uses a mesh bag to stop the heart from enlarging; it's mainly used in patients with heart failure. In a transplant, Raman will use an electrocautery, or diathermy, which cauterizes as it cuts and seals the small blood vessels, to cut through the pericardium, a sac that protects and contains the heart.

Twenty years later, he vividly remembers when he was a surgical resident seeing his first open chest cavity, a beating heart before him. Or else.
